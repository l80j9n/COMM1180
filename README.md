Woolworths launches app to deliver groceries in under an hour 
Woolworths   is   launching   a   new   quick   delivery   app   across   dozens   of   Sydney   suburbs   where   groceries can   be dropped directly to your   door within   an   hour.
The   service,   called   Metro   60,   has   staff   pack   your   order   from   the   shelves   before   it's   dropped   at   your door   by   delivery   partner   Uber for an extra fee   of $5.   Customers   have to spend a   minimum   of $20.
"Customers   can   get   their   food   and   groceries   delivered   to   them   in   60   minutes,"   Woolworths   Chief   Transformation Officer Von   Ingram said. 
"Speed   is   becoming   the   new   point   of   competition   for   online   food   and   grocery   competitors,"   retail   expert Garry   Mortimer said.
Customers can choose from 4000 items stocked in smaller Metro stores, including fruit and   vegetables,   pantry staples,   hot chickens, fresh sushi, flower   arrangements   and   pet food.
"It's   astore for   ultra convenience,   it's   about   being easy, fresh and   local   for the   neighbourhood   that   it   serves,"   Ingram said.
"We're really excited by some of   the local and Australian brands that we have like   the bread and butter   project."
It's   now   indirect competition with existing services   like   Milk   Run and   Door   Dash.
"I think the challenge that they face   is   range and   price,   you   might   be   able 代 写COMM1180 Value Creation T2 2024 LRVE Mock Exam Question 1SQL

"But   most shoppers tend to   look to the   major supermarkets for   major   brands   and   lower   prices."

Segmentation:
•          Characteristics   (demographic   and    behavioural)   of   deli   customers:   who   buys   during   the   day,   who   buys   early   in   the   morning   and   in   the   evening?   Do   these   segments   align   with   the   new   opening   hours?
