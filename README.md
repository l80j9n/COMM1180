Netflix   loses almost a million   subscribers
After enjoying along reign as the king of streaming,   Netflix faces a tough fight to keep   its crown.   It   lost   almost a   million subscribers   between April and July as   more   people   decided to   quit   the   service.
The   streaming giant   has   now   lost   members for two   quarters   in   a   row,   but the   drop   was   smaller   than it feared.
Asked   what   slowed   the   exodus,   the   firm's   boss   Reed   Hastings,   said:   "If   there   was   a   single   thing,   we   might say   'Stranger Things'."
The   new   season   of   the   hit   drama   has   been   a   phenomenal   success,   and   may   have   helped   stem   the   exodus of   Netflix customers.
The company reported its first subscriber loss since 2011   in April,   news that was followed by   hundreds   of job cuts and a   sharp   drop   in   its   share   price.
Rivals are challenging   its dominance, while   price   hikes   have taken   atoll.
The   subscriber   losses   reported   on   Tuesday   were   the   biggest   in   the   firm's   history,   with   the   US   and   Canada seeing the   highest   number of cancellations   in the   past three   months, followed   by   Europe.
Guy   Bisson,   executive   director   atAmpere Analysis,   said   it was   "inevitable" that   Netflix would   start to   see   its grip on the   market   loosen.
"When you're the leader, there's    only one direction to go, especially when a large amount of   competition   launches, which   is what   Netflix   has seen   in the   last couple of   years,"   he   said.
It is a stark change for Netflix, which enjoyed years of seemingly unstoppable growth, as   it   revolutionised the way   people around the world consumed   entertainment.
Its   position as a global giant was cemented when the   pandemic   hit   in   2020   and   people, stuck   at   home   with few other options for entertainment, flocked to   monster   hits   like   Squid   Game   and The   Crown.
But   as   pre-pandemic   habits   return,   Netflix   has   struggled   to   attract   new   sign-ups   -   and   maintain   the   loyalty of existing   member代 写COMM1180 Value Creation T2 2024 LRVE Mock Exam Question 2R

Netflix   was   once   the   disruptor,   making   video   rental   stores   like   Blockbuster   redundant.   But   the disruptor   is fast   becoming the disrupted.
Netflix's   move to   make   its service   more expensive   has also   put off   some   customers.

Required:Using the finance   and valuation   concepts from the   course,   explain   how   a   0.5%   decline   in   subscribers   can   reasonably   cause   a   30%   drop   in   the   share   price.   You   are   not   required   to   type   out   any   formulas.   You should   reference the concepts that you think   apply   and   use them   to   draw   a   connection   between   the   news about subscribers and the   share   price   of   Netflix.
Guidance   to   Q2
•          Share valuation   is   not about the   impacts   on   the   current   period
•          Equity   is   valued   as   a   function   of future   cash   flows
•          Identify    that    market    participants    have   fundamentally    re-assessed   the   growth    prospects   of   Netflix for all future   periods
•          Previously,   investors   assumed there   would   be   more   growth   from   Netflix   for   many   years   into   the future.   Now they   are   concerned   about   stabilisation   or   even   decline, which   started   in the   most   recent quarter as discussed   in the   case   study
•          Provide   linkage to valuation   theory/formulas:   equity   valued   as   a   growing   perpetuity/through   Gordon’s Growth Model. If   the growth rate goes from substantially positive   to zero or negative   (even while   holding the discount   rate constant), the share   price   will   fall   substantially
•          Also,   discussion   on   why   investors   would    likely   increase   the   discount   rate   because   of   higher   perceived   risk   to   the   business.   For   instance,   maybe   uncertainty   about   cash   (in)flows   in   the   future   have   now substantially   increased?
